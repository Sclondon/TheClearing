extends Node3D
## Poses a feral dog (creatures/dog/models/dog_*.glb) in code, every frame,
## from what its Dog (the parent) says it is doing. After Outside's HoundRig:
## paws follow a gait cycle and are put down with IK, and the spine, neck,
## head, jaw and lips are laid on top; the tail and the ears are on springs.
##
## THE GAITS are a dog's, chosen by its speed: a four-beat walk (each hind paw
## lands a quarter of a stride before the fore paw on its side), a trot on
## diagonal pairs, and a rotary gallop (hind, hind, fore, fore round in a
## circle) in which the back gathers and stretches once a stride and the whole
## dog is off the ground twice in it.
##
## WHAT IT DOES, on top of the gait (each eases in and out):
## - TRACKING: nose down. The head goes down to a hand's breadth off the
##   ground and casts from side to side along the trail, the nose working
##   (quick small jerks of the head), ears forward, the tail out level.
## - STALKING: stiff and low. It sinks on its legs with its shoulders hunched
##   up, its head held low and level with its back, stretched forward, its
##   tail straight out behind and still, hackles up, lip curled.
## - SNARLING: its upper lips are drawn up off its teeth (bones `lip_l` and
##   `lip_r`), the gums show, the jaw drops a little, the ears go back.
## - BARK and HOWL: the jaw keeps time with the voice it would have (there is
##   no sound here: the Dog's signals are where a game would play one). A
##   bark jerks the head and bounces the front of it; a howl throws the head
##   back, nose to the sky, the mouth an O that trembles.
## - THE LUNGE: it gathers itself down on its haunches, springs (it is
##   thrown up in an arc, stretched out, forelegs reaching, jaws wide), the
##   jaws snap shut, and it lands and takes the weight. (The Dog says when;
##   the game moves it forward by `Dog.lunge_push`.)
## - THE SHAKE: after a miss, a shake that runs from its head to its tail like
##   a wet dog's, ears flapping.
## - GLAD (friendly): its tail carried high and wagging hard, the whole of it,
##   its ears pricked up, its head up, hackles flat, its mouth a little open.
## - EATING: its head down to the ground, worrying at what it eats, jaws working.
## - Sitting and lying down, panting when it has run, the hackles (the Dog
##   sets the crest material's `bristle`).
##
## Every joint is read from the model's skeleton (tools/build_dog.py), so a
## model with other measurements on the same bones would do as well.
