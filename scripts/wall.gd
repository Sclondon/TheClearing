class_name Wall
extends StaticBody3D
## A wall: one solid box, `width` along X, `height` up and `depth` along Z, that
## stands on its origin (the middle of its base), and can be bumped into. Change
## any of it in the Inspector and it is redrawn at once.
##
## It is drawn with a texture (with its relief and roughness) laid on each face
## at its true size, one tile every `tile_size` metres, so a bigger wall shows more
## concrete, not stretched concrete. So that a big wall does not look like the same
## square over and over, the texture is broken up (`break_up`): a slow noise across
## the wall chooses which shifted copy of it shows where, blended where they meet
## (shifted only, never turned, so formboard lines and ribs keep their way), and a
## broad, slow change of tone is laid over it all (`variation`).
##
## The looks are photographed concrete from Poly Haven (CC0; textures/polyhaven/,
## see its CREDITS.md), concretes made by tools/make_wall_textures.gd, and the old
## stone blocks; or Custom, to keep textures of your own. Wall.material_for gives
## the same surface to anything else (the maze's walls are drawn with it).
