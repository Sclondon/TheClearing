## A low fog lying on the ground some of the time (Weather.ground_fog says how
## much; the user, 2026-10-18: "We should also have some fog layers low to the
## ground sometimes that change heights and have animated scrolling snoise that
## you can leave a wake in"). One flat sheet round the camera at the top of the
## fog, drawn by a shader that works out from the depth buffer how far each line
## of sight runs through the fog under it: thin looking down at your feet, thick
## and white looking out across it, nothing where the ground rises out of it.
## Its top rolls (two layers of noise drifting with the wind), and it rises and
## sinks slowly (Weather says how high).
##
## Whoever walks through it leaves a wake: players, runners and the creatures
## near the camera drop a point every half metre or so they go (TRAIL of them at
## most, kept a few seconds), and round each the fog is pushed down and aside,
## filling in again as the point ages.
##
## The bodies that stir it are looked for once a second (a group and the
## hunters' own list, never the scene tree), the nearest few kept.
